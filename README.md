# JS:

This script is included in the HTML code above. It automatically redirects the user after a specified delay.

- Additional notes:

You can replace the redirect URL with the URL of the website you want to redirect users to.
You can adjust the delay before the redirect by changing the value in setTimeout.
You can also add a button that allows users to manually redirect to the website if they don't want to wait.
Clean graphic:

- You can use a simple graphic for your redirection page. Here are a few suggestions:

A circular loading icon
A progress bar
A simple animation
A logo or brand image
It's important to keep the graphic clean and minimal to avoid distracting users from the redirect.

# Remember to replace the following:

[https://www.your-desired-website.com] with the URL of your desired website.
The graphic with your chosen image or animation.
This code will provide a user-friendly redirection experience with a clean and minimalist design.
